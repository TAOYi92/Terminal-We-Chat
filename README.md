# Terminal-We-Chat
Terminal version of We-Chat based on itchat package

Please install the `itchat` package first
```
pip3 install itchat
```

Next, make needed directory (For plan of next version, I will write a shell script)
```
mkdir /where/the/script/is/wechat_files
mkdir /where/the/script/is/wechat_files/file /where/the/script/is/wechat_files/picture_video_etc
```

And then, just run the python script in any terminal console by
```
cd /where/the/script/is/
./TerminalWeChat.py
```
or
```
python3 /where/the/script/is/TerminalWeChat.py
```
And when it has already launched, type `help` to see the basic instructions. :)
